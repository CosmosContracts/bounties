Want earn some $JUNO and build reputation? Welcome to Juno bounties. 

To claim a bounty, first you should message the core team to express your interest in one of the bounties. If approved you can start working on it and when it's complete you can submit a PR to this repo and add your Juno address to the corresponding row in the table. A member of the core team will evaluate your claim, and if successful you'll be paid out the reward.

_In addition, if you go above and beyond the call of duty, the reviewers may decide to offer a bonus._

## Cosmos SDK
These challenges focus on core Cosmos SDK functionality.


| Task                            | Description | Reward     | Claimed by |
|:--------------------------------|:------------|:-----------|:-----------|
| State Sync support for CosmWasm |             | 10000 JUNO |            |

## IBC
One of the most exciting things about Juno smart contracts, is that they are support InterChain by default. Currently, you can send tokens over IBC with a smart contract, but much more is possible. 

### Osmosis IBC Challenges

For these challenges, you'll need to create example CosmWasm contracts and documentation for interacting with Osmosis over IBC. In addition to $JUNO rewards, these challenges also have matching $OSMO rewards!

| Task                 | Description | Reward     | Claimed by |

| LP tokens over IBC   |             | 10000 JUNO |            |
