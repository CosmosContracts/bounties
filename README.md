# Juno Bounties

Want earn some $JUNO and build reputation? Welcome to Juno bounties. 

To claim a bounty, submit a PR to this repo and add your Juno address to the corresponding row in the table. A member of the core team will evaluate your claim, and if successful you'll be paid out the reward.

_In addition, if you go above and beyond the call of duty, the reviewers may decide to offer a bonus._

## Cosmos SDK
These challenges focus on core Cosmos SDK functionality.


| Task                            | Description | Reward     | Claimed by |
|:--------------------------------|:------------|:-----------|:-----------|
| State Sync support for CosmWasm |             | 10000 JUNO |            |

## IBC
One of the most exciting things about Juno smart contracts, is that they are support InterChain by default. Currently, you can send tokens over IBC with a smart contract, but much more is possible. 

### Osmosis IBC Challenges

For these challenges, you'll need to create example CosmWasm contracts and documentation for interacting with Osmosis over IBC. In addition to $JUNO rewards, these challenges also have matching $OSMO rewards!
